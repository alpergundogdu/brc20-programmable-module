Legend:
[T-shirt size] Endpoint: Notes

- Supported endpoints: Similar to eth

-- Existing endpoints (needs work)

✅ [XS] eth_blockNumber: convert to hex
✅ [XS] eth_getCode: block only "latest"
[M] eth_call: add a gas limit check - also, input output types should match with eth endpoint
[M] eth_getBlockByNumber: calculate logsBloom / BlockRes should be on par with eth endpoint
✅ [XS] eth_getBlockByHash: Same as above ^

-- New endpoints

✅ [S] eth_estimateGas: return only gas from eth_call
✅ [S] eth_getStorageAt: block only "latest"

---- Log endpoints (needs storage)

[XL] eth_getLogs: Record SerializableLogs to database or a file per block

---- Transaction endpoints (needs storage)

[S] eth_getTransactionCount: Return nonce at the latest block
[S] eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber
[S] eth_getBlockTransactionCountByHash
✅ [L] eth_getTransactionByHash: A database of txes by txhash to output
✅ [XS] eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex: Record txes and return
✅ [XS] eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex: Record txes and return
✅ [L] eth_getTransactionReceipt: Implement, record by txhash

- Static values: Values for BRC2.0 Prog

✅ [XS] eth_chainId: static - we'll choose
[S] eth_gasPrice: static - we'll calculate value

- Empty values: Unused in BRC2.0 Prog

✅ [XS] eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas: 0
✅ [XS] eth_blobBaseFee: 0
✅ [XS] eth_getBalance: 0
✅ [XS] eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber: Return 0
✅ [XS] eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash: Return 0
✅ [XS] eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex: Return null
✅ [XS] eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex: Return null

- Planned after release
